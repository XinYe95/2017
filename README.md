Following is something about my paper.

<strong>Abstract: 150-250 words</strong>

Lifelog can be described as a digital library of an individual's life, which is known for its ability to record life and help with memory. Autographer, a wearable camera that can captured images automatically, is always used for aiding episodic memory in lifelog system. In order to imporve the effectiveness of retrieving memory using lifelog, this paper proposed two novelty user-relative memory cues to extract important memories for lifeloggers. They are special sentiment cue and special movement cue. With the integration of 2 Autographers and sensors embedded in Android smartphone, we implement a web-based lifelog viewer for lifeloggers to conveniently retrieve memories. On account of our system, we invited some participants to test the usability and efficiency of using our system. The preliminary result showed positive potential of aiding episodic memory by using our approaches.

1.把encode改成code

一些想法：把实现架构也往上放，什么SSH啦，用到的技术啦什么的
注意：完全删除combination part，也就是说，我放上去的应该是两个内容：sentiment cue，sentiment cue加上movement cue

2. 在System Design中，分为Hardware Design、Software Design、还可以把sensor数据获取写进去
