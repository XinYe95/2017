Abstract—In the Virtual Reality (VR) environment, **`the`（可以去掉）** user needs
to input information and **`achieve`（achieves）** interaction with virtual objects.
At present, most VR systems provide some input devices, such
as keyboard and controller. However, using such devices **`is`（are）** not
intuitive, especially in the case of VR shopping system. In the real
world, we use our hands to handle objects. In virtual world, using
hand gestures to interact with VR shopping store will provide us
more intuitive VR shopping experience. According to the needs of
the room-scale VR shopping activities, we have introduced a new
gesture classification for the gesture set, which has three levels
to classify hand gestures based on the characteristics of gestures.
We have focused on the gestures in level 3. In our research, we
have built a room-scale VR shopping system and applied the new
hand gesture set for the interaction in the VR shopping system.
